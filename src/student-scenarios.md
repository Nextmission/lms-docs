## Scenario

- create account and login to the platform
- explore classes for specific category (ex: high school)
- find the subject i want to learn (ex: mathmatics)
- explore all instructors for this specific category and subject and find the right one
	-  each instructor provide an introduction and a free lesson or more, to help the student choosing the right instructor
- after finding the right instructor, i want to buy the course
- each student has a wallet, which contains points that he can buy courses with.
- i can buy points using the popular payment methods (ex: paypal)
- or i can buy points using points cards, that i can buy at local libraries. the points card has a code, that gives me points on my wallet when entered to the system.
- to find a local library that has points cards for the LMS, there should be page for partners in the LMS, which contains all libraries and shops, that has our points cards
- after buying the course, i get access to all course videos and course materials (pdf docuemtns, exams)
- there is differnt ways to go through the course and learning the subject
	1. do it by my self:
		- go through the course videos, materials and exams with your own learning schedule / plan.
	2. supervised learning
		- the instructor will guide you through the course
		- the instructor can create a learning schedule (example for a schedule: i'm allowed to finish only one lesson per day.  i have to finish the lesson quiz to be able to move to the next lesson, i have to complete one lesson per day / week ) and assigne it to you.
		- the system should enforce you to follow the rules defined by in the schedule of the instructor
	3. Parental  Control (this can be combined with supervised learning)
		- the parents can track the progress of their children
		- the parent receive notification (alarm), when their children are not doing very well in the course
